## Week 4 Homework Submission File: Linux Systems Administration

### Step 1: Ensure Permissions on Sensitive Files

1. Permissions on `/etc/shadow` should allow only `root` read and write access.

    - Command to inspect permissions: 
        ls -l /etc/shadow

    - Command to set permissions (if needed): 
    sudo chmod -R 600 /etc/shadow 

2. Permissions on `/etc/gshadow` should allow only `root` read and write access.

    - Command to inspect permissions: 
        ls -l /etc/gshadow

    - Command to set permissions (if needed): 
        sudo chmod -R 600 /etc/gshadow

3. Permissions on `/etc/group` should allow `root` read and write access, and allow everyone else read access only.

    - Command to inspect permissions: 
        ls -l /etc/group  

    - Command to set permissions (if needed): 
        sudo chmod -R 644 /etc/group 

4. Permissions on `/etc/passwd` should allow `root` read and write access, and allow everyone else read access only.

    - Command to inspect permissions: 
        ls -l /etc/passwd 

    - Command to set permissions (if needed): not needed but if needed sudo chmod -R 644 /etc/passwd

### Step 2: Create User Accounts

1. Add user accounts for `sam`, `joe`, `amy`, `sara`, and `admin`.

    - Command to add each user account (include all five users): 
        sudo adduser sam
        sudo adduser joe
        sudo adduser amy
        sudo adduser sara
        sudo adduser admin

2. Force users to create 16-character passwords incorporating numbers and symbols.

    - Command to edit `pwquality.conf` file: 
        sudo nano /etc/security/pwquality.conf 

    - Updates to configuration file: 
        minlen = 16

3. Force passwords to expire every 90 days.

    - Command to to set each new user's password to expire in 90 days (include all five users): 
        sudo chage -M 90 sam
        sudo chage -M 90 joe
        sudo chage -M 90 amy
        sudo chage -M 90 sara
        sudo chage -M 90 admin

4. Ensure that only the `admin` has general sudo access.

    - Command to add `admin` to the `sudo` group: 
        sudo usermod -G sudo admin 

### Step 3: Create User Group and Collaborative Folder

1. Add an `engineers` group to the system.

    - Command to add group: 
        sudo addgroup engineers 

2. Add users `sam`, `joe`, `amy`, and `sara` to the managed group. 
   - Command to add users to `engineers` group (include all four users):
        sudo usermod -G engineers sam
        sudo usermod -G engineers joe
        sudo usermod -G engineers amy
        sudo usermod -G engineers sara

3. Create a shared folder for this group at `/home/engineers`.

    - Command to create the shared folder: 
        cd /home 
        sudo mkdir engineers 

4. Change ownership on the new engineers' shared folder to the `engineers` group.

    - Command to change ownership of engineer's shared folder to engineer group: 
        sudo chown :engineers /home/engineers

5. Add the SGID bit and the sticky bit to allow collaboration between engineers in this directory. 

    - Command to set SGID and sticky bit to shared folder: 
        sudo chmod g+s, o+t /home/engineers 

### Step 4: Lynis Auditing

1. Command to install Lynis: 
    sudo apt install lynis -y 

2. Command to see documentation and instructions: 
    man lynis or sudo lynis --help 

3. Command to run an audit: 
    sudo lynis audit system 

4. Provide a report from the Lynis output on what can be done to harden the system. 

    - Screenshot of report output: sudo lynis audit system >> lynis_audit_report.txt 


### Bonus
1. Command to install chkrootkit:
    sudo apt install chkrootkit -y 
2. Command to see documentation and instructions:
man chkrootkit 
3. Command to run expert mode:
    sudo chkrootkit -x 
4. Provide a report from the chrootkit output on what can be done to harden the system.
    - Screenshot of end of sample output: sudo chkrootkit -x >> chkrootkit_h_report.txt
